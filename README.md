# Poetry is Easy by Alex Fig 

Currently you still have to run this program from the command line. 

When prompted you give the program a theme that is nine letters or 
less and then (after some time if the word is long) you will see a 
poem. 

This program takes the theme that it is given and finds all possible 
words that can be made from the letters in the theme. The poem it 
outputs is then a combination of these words in no particular order
but with a set structure. 

The original goal of this project was to identify what part of speech
the words I found were and construct a poem that is not such a 
grammar nightmare. Unfortunately nltk recognizes part of speech through
context clues in sentence structure and is unable to analyze words 
without context. Then there was the issue of if I did categorize 
words by part of speech then I would have to determine the correct 
verb conjugation for the random noun or pronoun I choose. 

The title of this piece was always going to be Poetry is Easy, however 
the implications changed as my realization of the complexity of the English
language came to light. Though in the end some of the pieces produced do 
have something poetic about them contradicting my schema about the precision 
that should go into poetry. 

In the end, English is hard to simulate progmatically by hand, but poetry as a
medium is meant to break such rules, so maybe poetry is easy?

I could honestly write a whole paper about these concepts, but I won't put you through
that.
